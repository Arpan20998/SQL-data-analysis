# ðŸ“š SQL Project: Bookstore Database Analysis

This project contains a set of practical SQL queries to analyze a sample bookstore database. The questions are designed for beginners to intermediate users learning SQL with real-world data scenarios.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

The dataset simulates a typical bookstore database with the following tables:
- `Books`
- `Customers`
- `Orders`
- `Genres`
- `OrderDetails`

You can find the SQL dump/sample schema in the [`data/`](./data) folder.
